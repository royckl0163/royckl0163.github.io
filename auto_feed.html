          The system focuses on developing an automatic feeding system with the use of Internet of Things (IoT).
          A hardware will be built using some robotics components and hanged aside the fish tank.
          A mobile application is developed for displaying the system’s current status and sending manual feeding request to the hardware.
          A mobile notification will be pushed every time after the feeding request is completed.
          The system will feed the tank under the following situation:
          <ol>
            <li>when the scheduled time reached;</li>
            <li>when users press the button in the mobile app; or</li>
            <li>when users press the attached robotics components</li>
          </ol>
          The system architecture is shown below:

        </figure>

        <h2>Hardware Architecture</h2>
        <p class="justify">
          The hardware comprises several robotics components: a touch sensor (for sending manual feeding request) and
          a servo motor (for rotating the feeding box and feed the fish tank). 
          All the components are connected to an ESP32 circuit board called Studuino:Bit, which is a product from Artec Co., Ltd.
          The Studuino:Bit contains a built-in Bluetooth and Wifi and can be programmed in Python.
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
          Besides the robotics part, the hardware also consists of a ready-made feeding box and a base which is built by Artec blocks. 
          It is designed for mounting aside the tank.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <h2>Realtime Database</h2>
        <p class="justify">
          The realtime database stores the latest information regarding the system, including the system status, the last and next feeding time.
          All the feeding requests (including manual and auto) will be passed to the database, thereby changing the system status. 
          The Studuino:Bit will obtain this information instantly from the database and handle the request.
          After the request is dealt with, the database will be updated.
        </p>

        <h2>Mobile Application (App) & Notification</h2>
        <p class="justify">
          The mobile application used to display the system’s current feeding schedule and send manual feeding request to the system when the user intend to change the feeding time.
          It also controls the status of the notification pushing service according to the users’ choice.
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
          Users can send instant manual feeding request or reschedule the next feeding time from the App even if they are not in the same network connection as the system. 
          If the rescheduled time is too close from last feeding one, an alert message will be poped out inside the app, informing user the request has been denied. 
          (Every feeding request should have a 3-hour gap in between.)
          After handling the feeding request, the app will automatically update the latest and next feeding time.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p class="justify">
          The system will send a POST request to the notification platform after handling the feeding request, 
          and the platform will push a mobile notification according to the request’s result.
          Inside the notification, it contains the result of the feeding request. 
          If the request fails, a reason will be included. 
          More importantly, a timestamp will be included indicating the time of handling the request. 
          If users do not want to receive the notification, it can be switched off through the developed mobile application.
        </p>
