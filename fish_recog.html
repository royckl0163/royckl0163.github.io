          The system focuses on developing a fish recognition system using machine learning (ML), which comprises two models: the fish detection model and the fish recognition model.
          A Flask API will be built as a connection bridge between the two models.
          A mobile application is developed for putting data into the API and displaying results to users.
          The system architecture is shown below:

        <h2>Fish Detection Model</h2>
        <p class="justify">
          When a user capture an image from the fish tank, the fish detection model will determine the number of fishes inside the photo.
          It will then crop the photo into small pieces according to the bounding box area inside the model response and put into the recognition model.
        </p>

          <figcaption>Demonstration of the model cropping image</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="justify">
          As shown above, the model recognised there are three fishes in the image. 
          A bonding box has incidiated the location of the fish, which aids the API to crop out the image into three small pieces according to the box area. 
          It will be introduced in the later part.
        </p>

        <h2>Fish Recognition Model</h2>
        <p class="justify">
          The cropped images will be put into the recognition model one by one to retrieve the fish name.
          All the result will be returned to the mobile application as a JSON data for result displayment.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <div class="container">

        </figure>
      
        <h2>Flask REST API</h2>
        <p class="justify">
          The API serves as a bridge for accessing the two ML models. It combines the two models’
          endpoint POST method into one to optimise the system operation time. It is developed using
          Flask in Python.
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
          Besides, the API uses Python libraries to crop the original photo into small pieces according to the bounding box area provided by the detection model’s response 
          and put it into the recognition model. In this way, it can also increase the accuracy of the recognition model.
        </p>

        <h2>Mobile Application (App)</h2>
        <p class="justify">
          The mobile application is the central controller and also the only frontend part of the system.
          Users can pass the photo sample to the backend part either by capturing instant photo or upload a image they would be the system to handle. 
          It will then send to the API for accessing the two models and retrieving the result to be displayed in the App.
        </p>
